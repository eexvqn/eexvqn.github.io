## Introduction

```{r, out.width = "100%",echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/eexuan/Downloads/AY2324 Sem1/NM2207/eexvqn.github.io/me.JPG")
```
I am a year 2 student studying Communications & New Media and Sociology in National University of Singapore. 

Here are more details on my education background:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
education <- data.frame(
  School = c("National University of Singapore", "Victoria Junior College", "Ngee Ann Secondary School"),
  Start = c(2022, 2020, 2016),
  End = c(2026, 2021, 2019)
)

knitr::kable(education)

```

## Choice of Topic

I chose the topic on deforestation after coming across an article which mentioned about the forest fires in the Amazon rainforest back in 2020. I remember seeing pictures of the Amazon rainforest in flames and how millions of animals were trapped in a black smog.

Image below shows the fires in Brazil.
<script>
  function toggleImages() {
    var imageCensored = document.getElementById('censored');
    var imageDeadAnimal = document.getElementById('deadanimal');
    
    if (imageCensored.style.display === 'none' || imageCensored.style.display === '') {
      imageCensored.style.display = 'block';
      imageDeadAnimal.style.display = 'none';
    } else {
      imageCensored.style.display = 'none';
      imageDeadAnimal.style.display = 'block';
    }
  }
</script>

<img id="censored" src="click.png" alt="Censored" onclick="toggleImages()" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover; display: block;"/>
<img id="deadanimal" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/2DB7/production/_108530711_hi056083251.jpg" alt="Dead Animal" onclick="toggleImages()" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover; display: none;"/>

This was one of the motivation behind choosing to focus on deforestation in Brazil. 

The other reason would be my interest in agricultural and livestock produce. I previously worked in a supply chain company, Oregano Trading Pte Ltd, and I recall that some of imports were obtained from Brazil. 

I sought to link both interests through the topic that I have chosen which focuses on deforestation as a consequence of agriculture and livestock in Brazil.

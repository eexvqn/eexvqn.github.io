## Introduction

Hi! My name is Ee Xuan. Here is a picture of me:

```{r, out.width = "100%",echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/eexuan/Downloads/AY2324 Sem1/NM2207/eexvqn.github.io/me.JPG")
```

## Education
I am a year 2 student studying Sociology and Communications & New Media in National University of Singapore. 

Here are more details on my education background:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
education <- data.frame(
  School = c("National University of Singapore", "Victoria Junior College", "Ngee Ann Secondary School"),
  Start = c(2022, 2020, 2016),
  End = c(2026, 2021, 2019)
)

knitr::kable(education)

```

## Interest
I enjoy volunteering at the side and I am a part of YMCA's Uni-Y Craft It! Programme where I do arts and craft with children who are less fortunate. Some of my other hobbies include running and crocheting.

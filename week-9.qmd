## Education
I am a year 2 student studying Sociology and Communications and New Media in National University of Singapore. 

Here are more details on my education background:

education <- data.frame(
  School = c("National University of Singapore", "Victoria Junior College", "Ngee Ann Secondary School"),
  Start = c(2022, 2020, 2016),
  End = c(2026, 2021, 2019)
)

# Display the data frame

```

## Experience
I worked as a Marketing Intern last summer in Oregano Trading Pte Ltd. I also have some experience working part-time as a retail staff at Under Armour and as a food and beverage staff in Andaz Hotel.

## Interest
I enjoy volunteering at the side and I am a part of YMCA's Uni-Y Craft It! Programme where I do arts and craft with children who are less fortunate.
